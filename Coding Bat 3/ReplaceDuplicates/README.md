# Coding Bat 3: Replace Duplicates 

Given an array of words, return a new array where all words that appear more than once are replaced by a given word.

Example: {"bike", "car", "bike"} with replacement word "walk" would produce a new array that contains {"walk", "car", "walk"}

Hint: Construct a new array of the same length as the input array. For each word in the original array, compare it to every other word. If you find a duplicate, assign the replacement word to the corresponding element in the new array. If no duplicate is found, assign the original word.
